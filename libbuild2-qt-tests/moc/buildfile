# Generate:
#
# moc_source.cxx from source.hxx
# sink_moc.cxx   from sink.hxx (note: unconventional output filename)
# sinc.moc       from sink.cxx
#
# Use a rule hint for cxx{sink_moc} because it breaks the moc naming
# conventions (which recommend a `moc_` prefix for outputs generated from
# headers).
#
# Add libue{QtCoreMeta} as a prerequisite to cause lib{Qt*Core}'s library
# metadata (exported options such as macro definitions, header search
# directories, etc.) to be passed to moc. Note that we cannot pass
# lib{Qt*Core} directly because the moc rule would be unable to choose between
# the shared or static version.
#
# Note moc{sink}'s extra dependency: this is a complication of cxx{sink_moc}
# being included instead of compiled, as is conventional. cxx{sink} includes
# and thus depends on cxx{sink_moc}. And given that moc{sink} depends on
# cxx{sink}, it also depends on cxx{sink_moc} (transitively). But due to the
# way moc extracts dependency information (as a byproduct of compilation), a
# moc output's generated dependencies have to be declared explicitly otherwise
# there is a very good chance moc will fail from a clean build state.
